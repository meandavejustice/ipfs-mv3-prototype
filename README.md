# IPFS-MV3-Prototype

This is an exploration into the limitations of [manifest v3]().

So far there are 2 branches exploring different options of forwarding IPFS traffic to local nodes.

* [service_worker_alpha](https://github.com/meandavejustice/ipfs-mv3-prototype/tree/service_worker_alpha)
* [declarativeNetRequest_alpha](https://github.com/meandavejustice/ipfs-mv3-prototype/tree/declarativeNetRequest_alpha)


## Releases
To save time there is a release created for `declarativeNetRequest_alpha`, `service_worker_alpha` will need to be pulled down and run `yarn build` to install.
